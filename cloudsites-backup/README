Cloudsites Backup
A toolset to help you backup your Rackspace Cloud Sites similar to how you 
would backup your Rackspace Cloud servers. Based off of information you can
find here:

The main problem is that this doesn't do a great job of automatically capturing
all of the DBs on your account from a list. Also, I'm unaware of any awy to pull
this info via an API, so a list of lists is really needed. Also, having one
cronjob per site seemed painful. So I started finding a way to mimic the way
Rackspace Cloud Servers are backed up (split tar.gz archives) into Cloud Files.

This is a work in progress, and things will change, but currently it goes like
this:

1. Update the shell script and python script as needed.
2. Run the .sh cron via perl (perl can natively run shell/bash scripts).
3. Does basic checks, then runs the python script to dump the DBs.
4. Tars up your entire customer folder on the storage array indicated.
5. Pushes those using PHP into the cloud - plan on making this python.
6. Deletes local db and tar files.
7. Rotates older files on the cloudsites container (not yet implemented).

So that's the basic idea. I'll try to update this as I go, or at the very least,
once I'm done. Hopefully, this will be useful to someone else.

Note that you will need the following library for the python scripts:
