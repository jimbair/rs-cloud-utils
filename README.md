rs-cloud-utils
==============

This repository is specifically for things I have put together to use with The Rackspace Cloud. My current project is a way to backup Cloud Sites into Cloud files, as that functionality does not yet exist.

As I find other things to work on, I will be sure to post them here as well.

Cheers!
